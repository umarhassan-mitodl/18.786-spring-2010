  caption: 'Relatively prime integers and zeta(2): The red dots are the coprime pairs
    of integers (x,y) with distance at most N (N = 20 in this picture) from the origin.
    They are connected to the origin by non-overlapping rays. The blue dots are all
    pairs of integers in the same disk. Their ratio tends to 1/zeta(2) = 6/pi^2 as
    N tends to infinity, where zeta(s) is the Riemann zeta funtion Sum\_n (1/n^s).
